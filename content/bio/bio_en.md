## Research Focus

I am conducting research aimed at correcting aberrations—image blurring caused by lens imperfections in electron microscopy—by utilizing 4D-STEM with a pixelated detector and electron ptychography in combination. At present, aberration correction in electron microscopy is typically performed manually. As a result, the clarity of the acquired images often depends on the operator’s skill, which presents a barrier to the broader adoption of electron microscopy. To address this issue, I am investigating the optical conditions under which aberrations can be quantitatively measured using electron ptychography, with the ultimate goal of developing a method that enables automatic aberration measurement and correction.
